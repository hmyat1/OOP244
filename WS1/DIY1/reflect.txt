The first part involved using provided code to create these modules, which was pretty straightforward.In the second part, I had to start from scratch and write a new function. The task of this function was to operate with a text file. It began by attempting to open the file and then prompting the user for a name. If the file could not be discovered, an error message would be displayed to the user. If the file was located, it requested a name and checked to see if that name was present in the file. If it identified a match, it displayed its result in the program. Otherwise, it kept asking for a name.So, in a nutshell, the workshop addressed namespaces, which are similar to containers for organizing and managing code. I learnt how to construct new functions, build programs from modules, and use namespaces to improve code structure.
